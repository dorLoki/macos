# Try Out Development Containers: C++

[![Open in Dev Containers](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Dev%20Containers&message=Open&color=blue&logo=visualstudiocode)](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-cpp)

A **development container** is a running container with a well-defined tool/runtime stack and its prerequisites. You can try out development containers with **[GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)** or **[Visual Studio Code Dev Containers](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers)**.

This is a sample project that lets you try out either option in a few easy steps. We have a variety of other [vscode-remote-try-*](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Amicrosoft+vscode-remote-try-&type=Repositories) sample projects, too.

> **Note:** If you already have a Codespace or dev container, you can jump to the [Things to try](#things-to-try) section.

## Setting up the development container

### GitHub Codespaces
Follow these steps to open this sample in a Codespace:
1. Click the **Code** drop-down menu.
2. Click on the **Codespaces** tab.
3. Click **Create codespace on main** .

For more info, check out the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/developing-online-with-codespaces/creating-a-codespace#creating-a-codespace).

### VS Code Dev Containers

If you already have VS Code and Docker installed, you can click the badge above or [here](https://vscode.dev/redirect?url=vscode://ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers/cloneInVolume?url=https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-remote-try-cpp) to get started. Clicking these links will cause VS Code to automatically install the Dev Containers extension if needed, clone the source code into a container volume, and spin up a dev container for use.

Follow these steps to open this sample in a container using the VS Code Dev Containers extension:

1. If this is your first time using a development container, please ensure your system meets the pre-reqs (i.e. have Docker installed) in the [getting started steps](https://aka.ms/vscode-remote/containers/getting-started).

2. To use this repository, you can either open the repository in an isolated Docker volume:

    - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Try a Sample...** command.
    - Choose the "C++" sample, wait for the container to start, and try things out!
        > **Note:** Under the hood, this will use the **Dev Containers: Clone Repository in Container Volume...** command to clone the source code in a Docker volume instead of the local filesystem. [Volumes](https://docs.docker.com/storage/volumes/) are the preferred mechanism for persisting container data.

   Or open a locally cloned copy of the code:

   - Clone this repository to your local filesystem.
   - Press <kbd>F1</kbd> and select the **Dev Containers: Open Folder in Container...** command.
   - Select the cloned copy of this folder, wait for the container to start, and try things out!

## Features
### Preinstalled Libraries
 * [{fmt}](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) is an open-source formatting library providing a fast and safe alternative to C stdio and C++ iostreams.
 * [Google Test](https://google.github.io/googletest/) is Googleâ€™s C++ testing and mocking framework.
### GitHub Action
GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline.
You may need to configure a runner. See [this](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners/adding-self-hosted-runners).

The current CI pipeline uses Clang for code formatting checks and Google Test for running unit tests, which are triggered on every push to the main branch.
